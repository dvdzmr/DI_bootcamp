    Add a badge with a number to the Contact link
    Add a dropdown menu to the right of the links.
    Add a sign-in form with email and password fields to the right side of the navbar.




Add a full width jumbotron. Copy/Paste the code below and add a button that says “Learn more”. The color should be primary.

<!-- Jumbotron -->
  <div class="p-5 bg-light">
    <h1 class="mb-3">Heading</h1>
    <h4 class="mb-3">Subheading</h4>
    <a class="btn btn-primary" href="" role="button">Call to action</a>
  </div>
<!-- Jumbotron -->


Under the jumbotron there should be 3 columns as seen below in the assets.

    Each column should have a button that says “View Details”. The size should be medium.
    Add an icon (You can use Fontawesome) to the “View Details” button.
    Add a badge that says “New” to the heading in the third column.
