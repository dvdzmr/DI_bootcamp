Roadmap

Here are some optional ideas and a rough plan for this project:

Week 1: A responsive site using HTML and CSS. You can layout the site using Grid, Flexbox or a CSS framework 
(We learn Bootstrap 5. But feel free to look at other like Materialize, Tailwind, etc. Here is a list of some great CSS frameworks..

During the Bootcamp

    Add some Javascript. This could include some animations, or interaction with the user in response to clicks. 
    A really nice idea would be to build a filter that allows the user to see only certain types of projects. Here is a great, simple example from w3shools..

    Add a Django backend or a React application with a Node.js backend to your site. New projects can be added to the site with full CRUD functionality. 
    An admin backend and database can allow persistence of state changes.

Ongoing: Add some asynchronous request to your site. A simple but good way to learn about asynchronous requests is to build a Like button 
and add them to each project. This will also teach you some fundementals of HTTP request / response, JSON, Request Headers and Sessions. 
Donâ€™t worry, we will cover it all!
